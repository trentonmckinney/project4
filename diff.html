			<p> The point of my website is showing a strong perspective of why Donovan Mitchell should be ROTY. The other part of my website is showing the diffrent ways why Ben Simmons shouldn't be ROTY. I talk about the bad aspects of Ben Simmons game and how he have more help then Donovan Mitchell. The way you can support Donovan Mitchell is watching his games and talking good about him on all social media platforms.
